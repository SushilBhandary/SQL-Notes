# Lecture 2: CRUD

## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to create tables, fetch data from them, update data, manage user permissions etc.

A simple query to create a table in MySQL has:
  - column names
  - data type of column (integer, varchar, boolean, date, timestamp)
  - properties of column (unique, not null, default)
Similarily, the table could also have properties (primary key, key)

## What is CRUD?

On any entity stored in a table, there are 4 operations possible:

1. Create (or inserting a new entry)
2. Read (fetching some entries)
3. Update (updating information about an entry already stored)
4. Delete (deleting an entry)

## Create

### CREATE Query


```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    firstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    dateOfBirth DATE NOT NULL,
    enrollmentDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    psp DECIMAL(3, 2) CHECK (psp BETWEEN 0.00 AND 100.00),
    batchId INT,
    isActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
);
```

### INSERT Query


`INSERT` statement in MySQL is used to insert new entries in a table. Let's see how we can use it to insert a new film in the `film` table of Sakila database.

```sql
INSERT INTO film (title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, rating, special_features) 
VALUES ('The Dark Knight', 'Batman fights the Joker', 2008, 1, 3, 4.99, 152, 19.99, 'PG-13', 'Trailers'),
       ('The Dark Knight Rises', 'Batman fights Bane', 2012, 1, 3, 4.99, 165, 19.99, 'PG-13', 'Trailers'),
       ('The Dark Knight Returns', 'Batman fights Superman', 2016, 1, 3, 4.99, 152, 19.99, 'PG-13', 'Trailers');
```

an example of a query without column names is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO film
VALUES (default, 'The Dark Knight', 'Batman fights the Joker', 2008, 1, NULL, 3, 4.99, 152, 19.99, 'PG-13', 'Trailers', default);
```

## Read

`SELECT` statement is used to read data from a table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM film;
```

Here we are selecting all the columns from the `film` table. The `*` is used to select all the columns. This query will give you the value of each column in each row of the film table. If we want to select only specific columns, then we can specify the column names instead of `*`. Example:

```sql
SELECT title, description, release_year FROM film;
```

Here we are selecting only the `title`, `description` and `release_year` columns from the `film` table. Note that the column names are separated by commas. Also, the column names are case-insensitive, so `title` and `TITLE` are the same. Example following query would have also given the same result:

```sql
SELECT TITLE, DESCRIPTION, RELEASE_YEAR FROM film;
```

Now, let's learn some nuances around the `SELECT` statement.

### Selecting `Distinct` Values

Let's say we want to select all the distinct values of the `rating` column from the `film` table. How do we do that? We can use the `DISTINCT` keyword to select distinct values. Example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT rating FROM film;
```

This query will give you all the distinct values of the `rating` column from the `film` table. Note that the `DISTINCT` keyword, as all other keywords in MySQL, is case-insensitive, so `DISTINCT` and `distinct` are the same.

We can also use the `DISTINCT` keyword with multiple columns. Example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT rating, release_year FROM film;
```

So, let's try to understand the above query with a pseudo code. The pseudo code for the above query would be as follows:

```python
answer = []

for each row in film:
    answer.append(row)

filtered_answer = []

for each row in answer:
    filtered_answer.append(row['rating'], row['release_year'])

unique_answer = set(filtered_answer)

return unique_answer
```

So what you see is that DISTINCT keyword on multiple column gives you for all of the rows in the table, the distinct value of pair of these columns.

### Select statement to print a constant value

Let's say we want to print a constant value in the output. Eg: The first program that almost every programmer writes: "Hello World". How do we do that? We can use the `SELECT` statement to print a constant value. Example:

```sql
SELECT 'Hello World';
```

That's it. No from, nothing. Just the value. You can also combine it with other columns. Example:

```sql
SELECT title, 'Hello World' FROM film;
```

### Operations on Columns

Let's say we want to select the `title` and `length` columns from the `film` table. If you see, the value of length is currently in minutes, but we want to select the length in hours instead of minutes. How do we do that? We can use the `SELECT` statement to perform operations on columns. Example:

```sql
SELECT title, length/60 FROM film;
```

Later in the course we will learn about Built In functions in SQL as well. You can use those functions as well to perform operations on columns. Example:

```sql
SELECT title, ROUND(length/60) FROM film;
```

ROUND function is used to round off a number to the nearest integer. So the above query will give you the title of the film, and the length of the film in hours, rounded off to the nearest integer.

### Inserting Data from Another Table

BTW, select can also be used to insert data in a table. Let's say we want to insert all the films from the `film` table into the `film_copy` table. We can combine the `SELECT` and `INSERT INTO` statements to do that. Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO film_copy (title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, rating, special_features)
SELECT title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, rating, special_features
FROM film;
```

Here we are using the `SELECT` statement to select all the columns from the `film` table, and then using the `INSERT INTO` statement to insert the selected data into the `film_copy` table. 

### WHERE Clause

Let's say we want to select all the films from the `film` table which have a rating of `PG-13`. How do we do that? We can use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on a condition. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13';
```

Here we are using the `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on the condition that the value of the `rating` column should be `PG-13`. Note that the `WHERE` clause is always used after the `FROM` clause. In terms of pseudocode, you can think of where clause to work as follows:

```python
answer = []

for each row in film:
    if row.matches(conditions in where clause) # new line from above
        answer.append(row)

filtered_answer = []

for each row in answer:
    filtered_answer.append(row['rating'], row['release_year'])

unique_answer = set(filtered_answer) # assuming we also had DISTINCT

return unique_answer
```

### AND, OR, NOT

Correct. We use things like `and` , `or`, `!` in programming languages to combine multiple conditions. Similarly, we can use `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` operators in SQL as well. Example: We want to get all the films from the `film` table which have a rating of `PG-13` and a release year of `2006`. We can use the `AND` operator to combine multiple conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13' AND release_year = 2006;
```

Similarly, we can use the `OR` operator to combine multiple conditions. Example: We want to get all the films from the `film` table which have a rating of `PG-13` or a release year of `2006`. We can use the `OR` operator to combine multiple conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13' OR release_year = 2006;
```

Similarly, we can use the `NOT` operator to negate a condition. Example: We want to get all the films from the `film` table which do not have a rating of `PG-13`. We can use the `NOT` operator to negate the condition.

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE NOT rating = 'PG-13';
```

An advice on using these operators. If you are using multiple operators, it is always a good idea to use parentheses to make your query more readable. Else, it can be difficult to understand the order in which the operators will be evaluated. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13' OR release_year = 2006 AND rental_rate = 0.99;
```

Here, it is not clear whether the `AND` operator will be evaluated first or the `OR` operator. To make it clear, we can use parentheses. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13' OR (release_year = 2006 AND rental_rate = 0.99);
```

Till now, we have used only `=` for doing comparisons. Like traditional programming languages, MySQL also supports other comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=` etc. Just one special case, `!=` can also be written as `<>` in MySQL. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating <> 'PG-13';
```

### IN Operator

With comparison operators, we can only compare a column with a single value. What if we want to compare a column with multiple values? For example, we want to get all the films from the `film` table which have a rating of `PG-13` or `R`. One way to do that can be to combine multiple consitions using `OR`.  A better way will be to use the `IN` operator to compare a column with multiple values. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating IN ('PG-13', 'R');
```

Okay, now let's say we want to get those films that have ratings anything oter than the above 2. Any guesses how we may do that?

Correct! We had earlier discussed about `NOT`. You can also use `NOT` before `IN` to negate the condition. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating NOT IN ('PG-13', 'R');
```

### IS NULL Operator

Now we are almost at the end of the discussion about different operators. Do you all remember how we store emptiess, that is, no value for a particular column for a particular row? We store it as `NULL`. Interestingly working with NULLs is a bit tricky. We cannot use the `=` operator to compare a column with `NULL`. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE description = NULL;
```

The above query will not return any rows. Why? Because `NULL` is not equal to `NULL`. Infact, `NULL` is not equal to anything. Nor is it not equal to anything. It is just `NULL`. 

Example:

```sql
SELECT NULL = NULL;
```

The above query will return `NULL`. Similarly, `3 = NULL` , `3 <> NULL` , `NULL <> NULL` will also return `NULL`. So, how do we compare a column with `NULL`? We use the `IS NULL` operator. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE description IS NULL;
```

Similarly, we can use the `IS NOT NULL` operator to find all the rows where a particular column is not `NULL`. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE description IS NOT NULL;
```

In many assignments, you will find that you will have to use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators. Without them you will miss out on rows that had NULL values in them and get the wrong answer. Example:
find customers with id other than 2. If you use `=` operator, you will miss out on the customer with id `NULL`. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id != 2;
```

The above query will not return the customer with id `NULL`. So, you will get the wrong answer. Instead, you should use the `IS NOT NULL` operator. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id IS NOT NULL AND id != 2;
```

## Update

this is used to update rows in a table. The general syntax is as follows:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = value WHERE conditions;
```

Example:

```sql
UPDATE film SET release_year = 2006 WHERE id = 1;
```

The above query will update the `release_year` column of the row with `id` 1 in the `film` table to 2006. You can also update multiple columns at once. Example:

```sql
UPDATE film SET release_year = 2006, rating = 'PG' WHERE id = 1;
```

Let's talk about how update works. It works as follows:

```python
for each row in film:
    if row.matches(conditions in where clause)
        row['release_year'] = 2006
        row['rating'] = 'PG'
```

So basically update query iterates through all the rows in the table and updates the rows that match the conditions in the where clause. So, if you have a table with 1000 rows and you run an update query without a where clause, then all the 1000 rows will be updated. So, be careful while running update queries. Example:

```sql
UPDATE film SET release_year = 2006;
```

## Delete

The general syntax is as follows:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE conditions;
```

Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM film WHERE id = 1;
```

The above query will delete the row with `id` 1 from the `film` table. If you don't specify a where clause, then all the rows from the table will be deleted. Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM film;
```

Let's talk about how delete works as well in terms of code.

```python
for each row in film:
    if row.matches(conditions in where clause)
        delete row
```
